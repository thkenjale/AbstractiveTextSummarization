# Abstractive Text Summarization using an Encoder-Decoder Architecture
Based on the approach from https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/06/comprehensive-guide-text-summarization-using-deep-learning-python/

## Project Description

This was my final project for Introduction to Natural Language Processing. I attempted to implement Abstractive Text Summarization with Deep Learning and Python. This is when an NLP model outputs an original body of text that summarizes a larger body of text (the input). I used Python with the **Numpy**, **Pandas**, **Sci-Kit Learn**, and **Keras** libraries.

### Dataset - https://github.com/mahnazkoupaee/WikiHow-Dataset

I trained the model with 100,000 entries from the wikihowSep dataset.
